# Boston House Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning endeavor that focuses on predicting house prices in the Boston area. Using a dataset containing various features such as crime rates, property tax, and accessibility to highways, we aim to build a regression model that accurately estimates house prices. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, our goal is to develop a reliable prediction system that can provide valuable insights for real estate stakeholders, homeowners, and potential buyers.

The R-squared value of 0.7112 indicates that approximately 71.12% of the variance in the house prices can be explained by the features in our model. Additionally, the adjusted R-squared value of 0.6840 accounts for the model's complexity and suggests that it performs well in predicting house prices while controlling for the number of features.
